# About the project
I commissioned this bot from a freelancer on Fiverr named [mdaniels6758](www.fiverr.com/mdaniels6758). I made some modifications and decided to open source the project in the hopes that it will benefit other Discord users, and that improvements can be brought to the project collectively.

# Wishlist / Bugs to Fix
Help, Suggestions, and Pull Requests are much appreciated!
- [ ] Purchasing awards via DM doesn't display the purchase altert in the channel specified in "prizePurchaseAlertChannel".
- [ ] Replace user.json database with a remote database → at the moment, if you deploy the bot on a platform like Railway (with code hosted on GitHub), you'll lose all the user data when you redeploy the bot.
- [ ] Create a starter for [Railway](www.railway.app/) with the token and channel ID as variables you can fill out prior to deploying → this would require the remote database issue to be resolved. Railway supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB.
- [ ] Create a version for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).
