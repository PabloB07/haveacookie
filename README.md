# Getting Started (Railway.app)
## Video Tutorial

## Written Instructions (Railway.app)
### Create your Discord Bot
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html
- Take note of the bot token
- Invite your bot to your server

### Create your Code Repository
1. Create a private clone of [this repository](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie) on GitHub.
2. In your repo, select the `data` folder, and click on [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json)
3. Edit the variables for your custom bot. You can customize the emoji, prefix, max per day, prizes, and prize channel.
4. IMPORTANT: Make sure to Add your bot token, database URL (next section)

### Host your bot
1. If you don't have one already, [create a Railway.app account](https://railway.app?referralCode=7ENqQl)
2. Create a new Project, and select "Deploy from GitHub repo".
3. In the same "New Project" window, also select "Provision PostgreSQL".
4. Once everything is deployed in Railway, select the project and click on the rectangle with the GitHub repo's name.
5. On the right window, click on the "Settings" tab, and in the "Environment" section, make sure the automatic deployment trigger is enabled.
6. Afterwards, click on the PostgreSQL rectangle.
7. On the right window, click on the "Connect" tab, and copy the "Postgres Connection URL".

### Update code with Database URL
1. In your GitHub repository, return to [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json) and paste the Postgres Connection URL for `"databaseUrl" :`.
2. Saving these changes will trigger the deployment of an updated Railway project.
3. Your bot should now be live and working.

### Testing the Bot
1. Give a reward: In any channel from a server where the bot exists, `@` mention a fellow user followed by the emoji. For example, `"thanks for the help @candidexmedia :cookie:"`
2. List of Prizes: Direct message the bot using your prefix set in [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json) followed by `prizes`.
2. Purchase: Direct message the bot using your prefix set in [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json) followed by `prizes` and the prize number (ie: "`!prizes 1`" for the first prize listed in the prize list)
3. Leaderboard + Check Balance: `@` mention the bot

# About the project
I commissioned this bot from a freelancer on Fiverr named [mdaniels6758](www.fiverr.com/mdaniels6758). I made some modifications and decided to open source the project in the hopes that it will benefit other Discord users, and that improvements can be brought to the project collectively.

# Wishlist / Bugs to Fix
Help, Suggestions, and Pull Requests are much appreciated!
- [x] Replace user.json database with a remote database ‚Üí at the moment, if you deploy the bot on a platform like Railway (with code hosted on GitHub), you'll lose all the user data when you redeploy the bot.
- [ ] Create a starter for [Railway](www.railway.app/) with the token and channel ID as variables you can fill out prior to deploying ‚Üí this would require the remote database issue to be resolved. Railway supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB.
- [ ] Purchasing awards via DM doesn't display the purchase alert in the channel specified in "prizePurchaseAlertChannel".
- [ ] Create a version for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).
